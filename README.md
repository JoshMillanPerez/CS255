Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design? Driverspass is an initiative that keeps tabs on drivers education failures. They desired a system that could collect data, bill customers for packages, choose the days and times for driving and testing, and let teachers participate as well. 

What did you do particularly well? I did a good job of compartmentalizing the project because there are many moving pieces. Everyone need a different level of access to the software. Tests and status reports must be graded and submitted by the teacher. With so many moving pieces, it may become confusing. The administrator needs to set or modify the prices, and individuals need to join up.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? I would update my diagrams and include a description of what they represent.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? After noting who required what, I started to organize it. Charges must be established and account information updated by the administrator. For services, users must register and make payments. Driving days must be graded and approved by instructors. All of these are crucial since they result in an effective business model and workflow.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system? I first made it function. People can't access something that isn't usable, therefore I did that. Then I created access for certain individuals so they could take different classes and complete their tasks. Then you check to see that everyone is functioning properly because something might go wrong during the process.
